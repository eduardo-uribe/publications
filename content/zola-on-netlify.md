This website is constructed with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) static site generator. Here are the two resources I referenced to deploy on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

1. Zola: [Netlify](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/deployment/netlify/) deployment
2. A publication by [Davide Del Papa](https://dev.to/davidedelpapa/zola-tutorial-how-to-use-zola-the-rust-based-static-site-generator-for-your-next-small-project-and-deploy-it-on-netlify-375n)

_P.S. The Netlify dashboard states "Deploys from GitHub with **Hugo**" which is incorrect but it works._
